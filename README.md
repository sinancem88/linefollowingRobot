# Line Following Robot Project

This project is a collaboration between @sinancem88, @DavidHarrisRid, and @Laszlu to create a line following robot using infrared sensors. The robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface autonomously.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno microcontroller
- L293D motor driver
- Infrared sensors

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the Arduino Uno and L293D motor driver according to the provided circuit diagram.
3. Upload the C++ code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
4. Power on the robot and place it on a surface with a black line on a white background.

## Functionality
- The infrared sensors detect the black line underneath the robot.
- The Arduino Uno processes the sensor data and controls the motors through the L293D motor driver to follow the line.
- The robot autonomously moves along the line until it reaches the end or encounters an obstacle.
